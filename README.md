# LearnRust  

This repository contains all the projects and code developed while working through the **"Learn Rust"** textbook. It serves as a personal workspace where I explored, experimented, and deepened my understanding of the Rust programming language.  

## Highlights  

1. **Learning and Experimentation**  
   - Includes all the core projects and examples from the textbook.  
   - A sandbox for experimenting with Rust's features and idiomatic practices.  

2. **Mini-Projects**  
   - Enhanced the **minigrep** project by implementing a **semantic similarity score** for more meaningful text searches.  
   - Built a **Hello Web Server** from scratch, diving into low-level web server implementation using Rust's standard library.  

## Why Rust?  

Rust is a powerful, modern systems programming language that prioritizes:  
- **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++.  
- **Memory Safety**: No null pointers or data races.  
- **Concurrency**: Easily write highly concurrent programs.  

This repository captures my journey of understanding these key features through hands-on projects.  

## Future Explorations  

- Dive deeper into async programming in Rust.  
- Implement a basic CLI application with error handling and logging.  
- Explore Rust's ecosystem, including frameworks like Actix-Web and Rocket.
